      <p class="item-name">Frontend</p>
      <p>Front-end development is the development of visual and interactive elements of a website that users interact with directly. It's a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, where HTML provides the structure, CSS the styling and layout, and JavaScript the dynamic behaviour and interactivity.

        As a front-end developer, you'll be responsible for creating the user interface of a website, to ensure it looks good and is easy to use, with great focus on design principles and user experience. You will work to make sure the final product meets the client's needs and provides the best possible experience for the end-users.

      <p class="item-name">Backend</p>
      <p>Backend web development is the part of web development that deals with the server-side of a web application. This includes creating and managing the server-side logic, connecting the application to a database, creating server-side APIs, handling user authentication and authorization, and processing and responding to user requests. 

        A backend developer is responsible for the development of server-side components of a web application i.e. working with databases, handling requests, creating server-side APIs that can be consumed by frontend developers to retrieve and manipulate data, ensuring the scalability of the systems

      <p>DevOps is a cultural and collaborative mindset that emphasizes communication, collaboration, integration, and automation between development and operations teams in order to achieve faster and more reliable software delivery.

        DevOps is not a specific job title or role, but rather a set of practices and principles that can be applied across a variety of roles in software development and IT operations. Anyone involved in the software development and delivery process can adopt a DevOps mindset and apply DevOps practices in their work, including developers, testers, operations engineers, product managers, and others.

      <p class="item-name">Cybersecurity</p>
      <p>Cybersecurity in the IT industry refers to the practices, technologies, and strategies employed to protect computer systems, networks, and digital information from unauthorized access, theft, damage, or disruption. With the increasing reliance on digital systems and the internet, cybersecurity has become a critical concern for businesses of all sizes and industries, as well as for individuals.

        Cybersecurity measures may include the use of firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, encryption, and access controls. IT professionals who specialize in cybersecurity also conduct vulnerability assessments and penetration testing to identify weaknesses in systems and networks and develop strategies to mitigate these risks.

    <div class="content-box">
      <p class="item-name">Blockchain</p>
      <p>Blockchain is a distributed, decentralized digital ledger that is used to record transactions across many computers in a secure and transparent way. Each block in the chain contains a unique cryptographic hash of the previous block, creating an immutable record of all transactions on the network. This means that once data has been added to the blockchain, it cannot be modified or deleted without the consensus of the network.

        One of the key benefits of blockchain technology is its decentralized nature. Unlike traditional centralized systems where a single entity controls the data and transactions, blockchain allows for a distributed network of users to verify and approve transactions, increasing security and reducing the risk of fraud.

Another benefit is transparency. Because all transactions are recorded on the blockchain and are publicly accessible, it is much harder for fraudulent activities to go unnoticed. This transparency also increases trust between parties, making it easier to conduct business and reduce disputes.
